    -- header --\n
    -- symbols --\n
    -- relocations --\n
    -- data --

each section is a continuous sequence of bytes separated by \n

header:
    nsyms nrels ndata
        nsyms - 2 bytes number of symbols
        nrels - 2 bytes number of relocations
        ndata - 2 bytes size of data

    if no symbols or relocations then value is 0

symbols:
    name value type
        name  - null-terminated name of symbol
        value - 2 bytes         symbol file-relative address
