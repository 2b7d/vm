Object file format:
    header \n
    symbols \n
    relocations \n
    data

each section is a continuous sequence of bytes separated by \n

header:
    nsyms nrels ndata
        nsyms - 2 bytes number of symbols
        nrels - 2 bytes number of relocations
        ndata - 2 bytes size of data

    if section is empty then value is 0

symbols:
    name value type
        name  - null-terminated name of symbol
        value - 2 bytes         symbol file-relative address
        type  - 1 byte          0 - local
                                1 - global
                                2 - extern

    symbols are numbered in the order they are listed, starting at 0

relocations:
    loc ref
        loc - 2 bytes data location to be relocated
        ref - 2 bytes symbol number

data:
    compiled bytecode
